# Learn NodeJS JWT

Here is me learning how to use JSON Web Token in NodeJS.
I was following this YouTube tutorial here:
Node.js API Authentication With JWT, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nafaH9SddU

The slight variation of code is simply to fit with my usual style of coding.

## How-to's:
### Run app
```
nodemon
```

### URLs for testing:
- http://localhost:5000/api/login
- http://localhost:5000/api/posts

### Sample Header format:
```
Authorization    bearer <token>
```
